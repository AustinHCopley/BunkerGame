You wrap your hand in the bandage and you climb up the ladder, you can still feel the pain in your hand from your cut. As you reach the top, you use the large key to unlock a big hulking hatch. It requires a lot of effort to lift the hatch, but as it lifts a bright light shines through. It's daylight! Excited you flip open the hatch and climb to the surface... But what awaits you is nothing, you are surrounded by nothingness. Only the cracked reddish brown clay by your feet as far as the eye can see. The heat begins to beat down on you and you realise you made a mistake. Maybe there was a reason you found yourself locked in what now appears to be an old abandoned bunker.
