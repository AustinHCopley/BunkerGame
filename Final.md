# Tests:

We have tested negative numbers, numbers out of range, characters, strings, and very large numbers. The code will just re-prompt the user for a correct input. With strings, the code will bug a little and prompt the user the same amount of times as there are characters in the string. For example, "Hello" will result in the code prompting the user 5 times. This however will not cause the code to fail or break, only glitch some. Any kind of number and 
character seems to handle perfectly fine as far as we can tell.


# Reflections:

In this project we tried our best to make our code as compact and simplified as possible. In doing this we wanted to have all of our text come from outside files. However, this was not a feasible goal given the complexity and time. As we worked on fixing this issue, it became clear it was more troublesome than it was worth at the time. In a new project we would like to figure out how to more effectively move text from a file to our program. There were points throughout our project where we made significant progress in shortening functions and calls. This helped minimize the number of redundant statements. We do think there is more room for improvement in terms of efficiency and coherency of our program but all in all I think we did a good job meeting the goals we set for ourselves.
