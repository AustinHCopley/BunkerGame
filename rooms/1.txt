Candlestick
You enter another concrete room, there is a flickering light hanging from the center of the room. There are two additional doors in this room one is a rusting metal door with a lock, another is a sturdy wood door, with the numbers 316 written on the front. It would appear as though you weren't the only person to be here before. There is a jacket strewn across the floor in a corner.
